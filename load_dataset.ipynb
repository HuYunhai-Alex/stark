      "But this nice little gadget lets me tie even #22 flies onto a leader with ease. (And I couldn't really tie those on even when I was 25!) Using this tool to thread the tiniest hook eyes onto a leader may sometimes take a little concentration (must use a leader size appropriate for the hook eye, after all), but threading isn't the main thing we need--invariably our problem is tying the knot itself, without crushing the hackle, burying the hook into our finger, or losing the fly in the river during the attempt to hand-tie the knot. With this tool, in 8 or 10 seconds a secure clinch knot is done. Zero chance of losing the fly, having to start over, or foul language. I now find it easy to make the decision whether to try a different fly, because changing flies costs me almost no fishing time.\n",

      "The tool ties securely to a cord on the vest and is just plain there when (constantly) needed. The knots are as clean & compact and good as a knot can be. One time I did not have this tool with me, and I lost 20 minutes of my last fishing hour changing flies a couple of times.\n",

There are some limitations to what it can help to accomplish.  For example, you cannot thread a line of large diameter through the eye of a smaller fly.  The 6X tippet or smaller diameters (7X, 8X, etc.) are required for the smaller flies.  Larger diameter tippets greater than 6X (5X, 4X, 3X, etc.) can be threaded into medium and large flies.  I was skeptical at first (and sometimes still don't accomplish all tasks that I would like to) but it has been tremendously helpful with knot tying as well.  Tying tippet-knots that create leader at the end of fly line is much simpler and quicker, and so is the knot thats needed once the line is threaded through the eye of the hook/fly.  The magnet that holds the fly is relatively strong to secure the fly while threading the eye.  Those who struggle with focusing (poor vision) will especially find it helpful.  Ive found it a worthwhile purchase and would recommend it to a friend.  At times, it has been my only method of achieving certain tasks.\"\n",

      "text: \"So I was fly-fishing on the river and nothing was biting. So I decided to try a different fly. AftER about five minutes of trying and messing with the fly threader I purchased on a auction site. I pulled the tippet up off of the thread to learn the tippet wasn't in the hook eye, and seeing my fly pop up and drop in the river. I just lost another $1.50 fly and that was my last one. So I decided to try this threader before I quit fly fishing. Not only has this threader work for me everytime. But it's also a knot tyer. So now I can change flies in about a minute, instead of the 20 minutes it did before. This thread has a ring to clip to my lanyard, or to my zinger for easy access. Wish I would have purchased years ago. I might have done more fishing! Yes! I would recommend this to anyone!\"\n",

      "  - summary (protein summary text): This gene encodes a member of the cytochrome P450 superfamily of enzymes. The cytochrome P450 proteins are monooxygenases that catalyze many reactions involved in drug metabolism and synthesis of cholesterol, steroids and other lipids. This protein localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum and its expression is induced by glucocorticoids and some pharmacological agents. This enzyme is involved in the metabolism of approximately half the drugs in use today, including acetaminophen, codeine, cyclosporin A, diazepam, erythromycin, and chloroquine. The enzyme also metabolizes some steroids and carcinogens. This gene is part of a cluster of cytochrome P450 genes on chromosome 7q21.1. Previously another CYP3A gene, CYP3A3, was thought to exist; however, it is now thought that this sequence represents a transcript variant of CYP3A4. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2020].\n",
